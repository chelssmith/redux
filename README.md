# Redux Store

## Description
This app is a refactoring of an activity we completed in class. The activity is now using Redux which is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Usage
Within the integrated terminal of your app run:

    cd server npm run seed
Followed by: 

    concurrently \"cd server && npm run watch\" \"cd client && npm start\"
